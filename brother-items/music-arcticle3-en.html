									Wenshan Fang: the "Chinese Style" Vibrating the Clouds,<br>Thanks to the Traditional Culture

								<br><h4 class="text-center">Picture：Wenshan Fang (Source: Xin Hua Network)</h4><br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the beginning of the creation, I have about 500 lyrics, and the so-called Chinese style songs account for only about one-sixth of the total creation. But everyone is most impressed with the lyrics that I have created, or the ones that are most likely to cause discussion. It is precisely these "Chinese style" creations. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone pays attention to this one-sixth of Chinese style works, perhaps because these works are very "China", with a strong cultural recognition, and this cultural recognition separates it from other popular music areas. My personal style. 

								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, we should first discuss what culture is. Culture refers to the identity, living habits, identity of ethnic groups and beliefs shared by a particular ethnic group in a natural geographical environment. Culture is expressed in the form of language, writing, food, clothing, festivals, architecture, faith, art, etc., and art is subdivided into literature, drama, music, dance, painting, sculpture, architecture and the eighth art film. Simply put, the sum of a society's shared values of society is called culture. For example, there are three "waits" in "Fireworks are easy to cold": Let me wait, the history turns; wait for the wine to be mellow; wait for you to play a guzheng. There are three "provocations" in "Blue and White Porcelain": the curtains outside the curtains cause showers, the door knocks provoke the patina, and I pass the Jiangnan town to provoke you. The three "equal" and "three" in this place use the ratio in rhetoric. Once such lyrics are translated, the part-of-speech conversion, and the anthropomorphic and arbitrarily created words will lose their sense of beauty. In a nutshell, culture is something that is lost between translations. 

								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is cultural recognition? Facing a certain thing with cultural symbolic attributes, it does not require special words and verbal explanations. It can be judged by the average person's life experience what is the cultural attribute. Taking architecture as an example, architecture is the city's cultural business card, whether it is the Huizhou architecture of the south of the Yanyu River, the southern Fujian architecture, the ancient city of Pingyao in Shanxi, or the Japanese castle tower, the Gothic church, the German Neuschwanstein... Cultural identity. Every nation and region has its own aesthetic and cultural soil, which is the meaning of multiculturalism. The text can be said to be the beginning of civilization, carrying the task of knowledge transfer and inter-ethnic communication. Compared with other writing systems, Chinese characters have a unique cultural recognition that transcends time and space, geography and dialect. A stone monument two thousand years ago was unearthed in China, and middle school students can understand it. There are almost only Chinese characters in the world. The immortality of Chinese characters has enriched the diversity of human civilization. 

								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet age is known as the third industrial revolution. It is not far away, does not need a specific location, does not require large space, and synchronizes the characteristics of timely dissemination, making it a very important choice for the promotion of traditional culture in this contemporary time and space background. In the past, the promotion of traditional culture may be a calligraphy exhibition, a guqin performance, or a Beijing opera performance. These are just point effects. But the Internet has the advantage of penetrating the entire face, and no carrier can be shouldered or replaced. 

								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But at the same time, a good platform, if only the published pipeline is smooth, does not mean that it will have a good communication effect. Therefore, the form of packaging and marketing traditional culture is the biggest issue at the moment. Years ago, I was invited to lecture at the Forbidden City in Beijing. The topic given by the organizers was: How to get young people to get close to traditional culture. This issue presupposes that young people are not close to traditional culture. So what are they close to? They are close to popular culture. Television, movies, drama, fiction, games, and pop music are all so-called popular cultures. In other words, if you want traditional culture to gain popular and wide-ranging influence, you can use popular methods to promote it. For example, I am preparing a network drama with calligraphy as a drama element. Based on the popular drama tension and the story of the characters close to real life, I bring out the cultural connotation and texture of traditional calligraphy, and use the drama to let everyone agree with calligraphy. Rediscovering the beauty of calligraphy from the drama, re-recognizing the unique and most culturally recognized Chinese calligraphy art in the history of human civilization, and is proud of this immortal writing style. 

								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, letting traditional culture gain popular influence through popular methods should be the way to re-establish the traditional culture of the Internet age. (Famous lyricist Wenshan Fang)
