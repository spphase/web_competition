								With the Ancient Poems
							</h2>

							<p>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Before the bed, the moonlight is suspected to be frost on the ground. I look up at the moon and look down on my hometown." I have never had the parents who forced me to recite ancient poems since I was a child. My interest in ancient poetry is completely acquired and spontaneous. The first ancient poem is this "Quiet Night Thinking". When I was about the first day, I bought this collection of poems. I took one of them every morning. I didn’t like it very much at the time. It seemed to be like “the rain is clear during the Qingming period, and the people on the road want to break the soul”. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  For a long time, my favorite is Nalan Xingde's "Huan Xi Sha (浣溪沙)": "Whoever read the West Wind alone, Xiao Xiao Huang Ye closed the window. Contemplative past the erection of the sun. The wine was shocked by the spring, the book was won Splashing tea, it was only ordinary at the time." The past can not be reproduced, the dead wife can not resurrect, only nostalgia! 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I also like "Night Rain Sending North": "Jun asked if there is no return period, Bashan night rain rises in the autumn pool, why do you cut the western window candle, but when the Bashan night rains." In the middle of the night, the distant wife, Acacia can not see. This feeling of desolateness and feelings of thought can always resonate with the heart. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later, when I saw it gradually, I probably entered a free kingdom. I can often find some good ancient poems. It is not necessarily a famous article written by a celebrity, and it is not always quoted by others. Many ancient poems will never be forgotten once they fall in love. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, every time I pick up an ancient poem, I always hope that I will love you at first sight. However, poetry is a gift from God to the world, and it is impossible to ask for it. Good poetry is always limited. Even if it is a celebrity work that has been recognized by both ancient and modern, if you don't like it, then you can only dislike it. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, there is always love at first sight. Li Shangyin's "Jin Se", I have read countless times of explanations, and I can't fully understand the feelings. However, I like it, I like it inexplicably, I like it at first sight... "The sorrowful fifty string, one string and one column Sihua In the year, Zhuang Shengxiao dreams of butterflies, and Wang Dichun heart cares for Du Fu. The moon and pearls of the sea have tears, and the blue sky is warm and jade. This situation can be remembered, but it was already stunned." Some people thought it was a sinister work, or thought it was patriotic. The article, or thought it is self-contrast, or thought it is to write and miss the child. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But in any case, the quiet, sad emotions in the deep heart of the people touched me. I wanted to understand the meaning of this poem and felt that I didn't need to understand it. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a poem of squatting, "There is no severance, and it goes with the occasion. The evening wind blows the boat, the flower road enters the Xikou. The night turns west, the mountain looks south. The pool smoke dissolves, Lin Yue Low backwards. Livelily and pervasive, willing to hold the shackles." Chunjiang, moonlight, flower road, boat... beautiful, quiet and fascinated. "Being alive and permeating, I am willing to be a shackle." The world of life is just like the smog of the smog on the brook. I am willing to be a stalker of the singer. This poet is not known to the world. This poem is not popular, but I just like it. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese poetry has a magical sense of existence. When we saw a group of birds flying over the lake, we found out that "the sunset and the lonely sky are flying together, and the autumn water is always the same day", instead of quarreling there: I am going, all birds! When we went to Gobi to travel and rode on a horse, we silently thought, "The desert is solitary, the river is falling," instead of shouting: Oh, my mother, it’s all sand, go back! This is of course a kind of ridicule, but unconsciously, the beautiful existence of poetry is revealed. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   By the time of my life, the mood of ancient poets has become more and more empathetic. The reincarnation of the four seasons, the passing of time, the yearning for a quiet and beautiful life, and the unforgettable feelings of the ancients, the uncomfortable feelings of life, the loneliness and loneliness of no one to understand, and the wandering of foreign countries... 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In my heart, the best companion is to give me a quiet and fresh state of mind, these ancient poets who have died for thousands of years. These poets, who are unseen and have a rich inner world, where are you? Maybe you are sleeping in the nameless wilderness of Sichuan, Henan, and Shaanxi, but it is my best friend. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a blessing to be born behind you. Your poems are Scorpio, a swan song, a meteor that rushes into the world in the universe, beautiful and beautiful. It is said that the ancient books we saw today are less than one-tenth of the creations of the ancients. It is really regrettable. How many beautiful and lonely hearts are in the depths of the river that sinks into time. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Implicit, elegant, graceful, affectionate, and endless. This is always included in the ancient poems, a heart that will never deteriorate in China, and the beauty that the Western nation will never experience. I am glad that my native language is Chinese. I can get great spiritual enjoyment and comfort from these ancient poems...
