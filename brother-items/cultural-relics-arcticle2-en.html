								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Qing Dynasty ancient stage in the Beichen Shuangjie Ziyu Garden is under construction. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Careful care is provided during the construction. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day, visitors from all over the country are welcome to 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collect valuable cultural relics in his collection. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carefully arranged to collect old bricks from all over the country. The old tile, the stone sculpture art museum devoted his most half-hearted efforts. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inheriting the history of the millennium, the culture spanning time and space, blending in a exhibition hall of more than 2,000 square meters... In the exhibition hall of the Tianjin Stone Carving Art Museum, more than 300 pieces of cultural relics from the Han Dynasty to the Ming and Qing Dynasties, time and space Stacking and stirring, draw a fascinating picture of ancient stone carving culture. So far, the museum has received more than 30,000 guests from home and abroad. Many colleges and universities such as Tianjin Academy of Fine Arts, Business School, Normal University, and Fine Arts School have signed a teaching base agreement here. Graduate students and undergraduates from various universities have written internships in museums. Many people have commented that this is a meritorious deed to promote Chinese traditional culture. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The person who did this was Wang Shuyu, the founder of the museum. He was the winner of the May 1st Labor Medal in Tianjin, an outstanding Communist Party member, and the president of the Ancient Stone Carving Art Research Association of Beichen District, Tianjin. He is passionate about charity, is kind and helpful, and the people who have received his support are too numerous to enumerate. After the Wenchuan Earthquake, he went to the sky and he bought a whole vehicle for his own money. He went to the disaster area to express his condolences day and night. Last year he donated hundreds of thousands of yuan to the Red Cross in the name of the Ancient Stone Carving Art Research Society. This year, he also invested heavily in the construction of a Qing Dynasty ancient stage in the Beichen Shuangjie Ziyu Garden, which provided a new landscape for the people of Jincheng. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early years, nearly 200 pieces of theatrical figures collected by Wang Shuyu were certified by the Guinness World. In order to enrich the cultural connotation of Tianjin, he has been exhibited at the Tianjin Theatre Museum for free for 16 years. In the process of collecting, Wang Shuyu began to contact ancient stone carvings and quickly integrated into the ancient stone carving collection circle. The variety and quantity of the collections are well-known in Tianjin. Seeing that many ancient stone carving art treasures have been lost, weathering has become more and more serious, and some have even been stolen and lost overseas. He is extremely sad. At this time, Wang Tongli, the director of the Tianjin Confucian Temple Museum, found Wang Shuyu and formed the helper unit of the Temple of Literature and Wang Shuyu's Huiyu Culture Company. Wang Shuyu invested and built the city's first stone carving art museum to fill the Tianjin stone carving culture field. a blank. Later, Wang Shuyu built a website of the Tianjin Stone Carving Art Museum and the ancient stone inscription to study the WeChat public number, which also provided clues for the tracing of the cultural relics case in Shandong. In November 2015, the fishermen’s police in Shandong Province cracked together Years ago, the cultural relics were stolen. Without his protection of ancient stone carvings, stolen cultural relics may be difficult to see. 
								<br>
								&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The charity of Wang Shuyujian Museum has touched many domestic and foreign collectors. With the help of a patriotic Taiwan compatriot, he built a second stone art boutique, and most of the exhibits in this museum are free of charge from some domestic collectors. which provided. When asked if he personally spent a lot of money to build a museum, he said: "The only thing I can do is to rescue and protect the existing ancient stone carvings and make good things for the Tianjin people in spiritual culture. As an old man. Party members and entrepreneurs, I just want to do more public welfare work and give back to the society. Now I am doing this thing is a positive energy thing, worth it!" Finally, Wang Shuyu also said that the Tianjin Stone Carving Art Museum is a purely public museum. Open to the public, never get tickets, don't charge a penny!
